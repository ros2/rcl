This document is a declaration of software quality for the `rcl_yaml_param_parser` package, based on the guidelines in [REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

# `rcl_yaml_param_parser` Quality Declaration

The package `rcl_yaml_param_parser` claims to be in the **Quality Level 1** category.

Below are the rationales, notes, and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Quality Categories in REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

## Version Policy [1]

### Version Scheme [1.i]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` uses `semver` according to the recommendation for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#versioning).

### Version Stability [1.ii]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` is at a stable version, i.e. `>= 1.0.0`.

There is an automated test which runs a linter that ensures each file has at least one copyright statement.

The results of the test can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_yaml_param_parser/copyright/).

## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

Most features in `rcl_yaml_param_parser` have corresponding tests which simulate typical usage, and they are located in the [`test`](./test) directory.
New features are required to have tests before being added.
Currently nightly test results can be seen here:
* [linux-aarch64_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux-aarch64_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_yaml_param_parser/)
* [linux_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_yaml_param_parser/)
* [mac_osx_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_osx_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_yaml_param_parser/)
* [windows_release](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_win_rel/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_yaml_param_parser/)

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

Each part of the public API has tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added. The tests aim to cover both typical usage and corner cases, but are quantified by contributing to code coverage.

### Coverage [4.iii]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` follows the recommendations for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#code-coverage), and opts to use line coverage instead of branch coverage.

This includes:

- tracking and reporting line coverage statistics
- no lines are manually skipped in coverage calculations

Changes are required to make a best effort to keep or increase coverage before being accepted, but decreases are allowed if properly justified and accepted by reviewers.

Current coverage statistics can be viewed [here](https://ci.ros2.org/job/nightly_linux_coverage/lastSuccessfulBuild/cobertura/src_ros2_rcl_rcl_yaml_param_parser_src/). A description of how coverage statistics are calculated is summarized in this page ["ROS 2 Onboarding Guide"](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#note-on-coverage-runs).

### Performance [4.iv]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` follows the recommendations for performance testing of C/C++ code in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#performance), and opts to do performance analysis on each release rather than each change.

The performance tests of `rcl_yaml_param_parser` are located in the [test/benchmark directory](https://github.com/ros2/rcl/tree/rolling/rcl_yaml_param_parser/test/benchmark).

Package and system level performance benchmarks that cover features of `rcl_yaml_param_parser` can be found at:
* [Benchmarks](http://build.ros2.org/view/Rci/job/Rci__benchmark_ubuntu_focal_amd64/BenchmarkTable/)
* [Performance](http://build.ros2.org/view/Rci/job/Rci__nightly-performance_ubuntu_focal_amd64/lastCompletedBuild/)

Changes that introduce regressions in performance must be adequately justified in order to be accepted and merged.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` uses and passes all the standard linters and static analysis tools for a C package as described in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Contributing/Developer-Guide.html#linters-and-static-analysis).

Results of the nightly linter tests can be found [here](https://ci.ros2.org/view/nightly/job/nightly_linux_release/lastBuild/testReport/rcl_yaml_param_parser).

## Dependencies [5]

Below are evaluations of each of `rcl_yaml_param_parser`'s run-time and build-time dependencies that have been determined to influence the quality.

It has several "buildtool" dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they do not contribute to the public library API.
It also has several test dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they are only used to build and run the test code.

### Direct Runtime ROS Dependencies [5.i]/[5.ii]

#### `rcutils`

`rcutils` provides commonly used functionality in C.

It is **Quality Level 1**, see its [Quality Declaration document](https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/blob/rolling/QUALITY_DECLARATION.md).

`libyaml_vendor` is a vendor package for the libyaml C library.

It is **Quality Level 1**, see its [Quality Declaration document](https://github.com/ros2/libyaml_vendor/blob/rolling/QUALITY_DECLARATION.md).

### Direct Runtime Non-ROS Dependencies [5.iii]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` has the following runtime non-ROS dependencies.

#### `libyaml`

`libyaml` is a YAML parsing library written in C.

It is **Quality Level 1**, see its [Quality Declaration document](https://github.com/ros2/libyaml_vendor/blob/rolling/libyaml_q_declaration.md).

## Platform Support [6]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` supports all of the tier 1 platforms as described in [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers), and tests each change against all of them.
