The package `rcl_yaml_param_parser` claims to be in the **Quality Level 4** category.

Below are the rationales, notes, and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Requirements for Quality Level 4 in REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

## Version Policy [1]

### Version Scheme [1.i]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` uses `semver` according to the recommendation for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#versioning).

### Version Stability [1.ii]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` is at a stable version, i.e. `>= 1.0.0`.
The current version can be found in its [package.xml](package.xml), and its change history can be found in its [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.rst).

### Public API Declaration [1.iii]

All symbols in the installed headers are considered part of the public API.

All installed headers are in the `include` directory of the package, headers in any other folders are not installed and considered private.

### API Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.iv]/[1.vi]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` will not break public API within a released ROS distribution, i.e. no major releases once the ROS distribution is released.

### ABI Stability Within a Released ROS Distribution [1.v]/[1.vi]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` contains C and C++ code and therefore must be concerned with ABI stability, and will maintain ABI stability within a ROS distribution.

## Change Control Process [2]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` follows the recommended guidelines for ROS Core packages in the [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/#package-requirements).

## Dependencies [5]

Below are evaluations of each of `rcl_yaml_param_parser`'s run-time and build-time dependencies that have been determined to influence the quality.

It has several "buildtool" dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they do not contribute to the public library API.
It also has several test dependencies, which do not affect the resulting quality of the package, because they are only used to build and run the test code.

### Direct Runtime ROS Dependencies [5.i]/[5.ii]

#### `rcutils`

`rcutils` provides commonly used functionality in C.

It is **Quality Level 4**, see its [Quality Declaration document](https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/blob/master/QUALITY_DECLARATION.md).

#### `libyaml_vendor`

`libyaml_vendor` is a vendor package for the libyaml C library.

It is **Quality Level 4**, see its [Quality Declaration document](https://github.com/ros2/libyaml_vendor/blob/master/QUALITY_DECLARATION.md).

### Direct Runtime Non-ROS Dependencies [5.iii]

`rcl_yaml_param_parser` has the following runtime non-ROS dependencies.

#### `libyaml`

`libyaml` is a YAML parsing library written in C.

It is **Quality Level 4**, see its [Quality Declaration document](https://github.com/ros2/libyaml_vendor/blob/master/libyaml_q_declaration.md).
